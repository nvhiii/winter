- currently working on basic css styling
- :hover is a selector
- transtion is a powerful property
	Syntax:
	parent class / property {
		transition: transform [time in sec or ms] ease-[in-out, etc.], any other functions followed by same format
	
	parent class:selector {
		transform: scale(1.1);
	}
- transform is also a valuable function, many others like it which can be used for fluid sites
- opacity property
- translate function
- in popups
	Syntax:
	parent class / property {
		transition: translate 275ms ease-in-out, opacity 300ms ease;
		transform: translate(-50%, -100%);
	}

	child {
		transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
	}
